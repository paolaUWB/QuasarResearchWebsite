In the last two decades, we have learned that the innermost active regions of galaxies, that supply gas to the central supermassive black hole, and the surrounding regions out to kiloparsec scales are connected through feedback processes, suggesting a co-evolution scenario.  Evidence for this includes the tight correlation between the masses of supermassive black holes and that of the stellar spheroids of their host galaxy. 
and the need for regulating star formation in the host galaxies. 
Nevertheless, our physical understanding of how galaxies and their inner active nuclei interact remains largely unknown given that they exist on two very different physical scales.
